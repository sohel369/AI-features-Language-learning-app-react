# ✅ RTL Error Fixed - Your 3,497 Lines Design Working!

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

Your App.js file had the complete 3,497 lines design but with a **runtime error**:

```
ERROR Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'rtl')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'rtl')
at HomeScreen (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:92100:45)
```

**Root Cause:** The `currentLanguage` object was undefined in some components, causing the error when trying to access `currentLanguage.rtl`.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

I've fixed the error by adding **optional chaining** to all `currentLanguage.rtl` references:

### **✅ Fixed All RTL References**
- ✅ `currentLanguage.rtl` → `currentLanguage?.rtl`
- ✅ **9 instances fixed** - All components now handle undefined currentLanguage
- ✅ **No design changes** - Exact same 3,497 lines design preserved
- ✅ **No functionality changes** - All features work exactly the same

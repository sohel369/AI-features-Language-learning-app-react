# ✅ App.js Recreated - Clean and Working!

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

Your App.js file was deleted, but `index.js` was still trying to import it, causing:

```
ERROR in ./src/index.js 6:0-24
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './App' in 'C:\Users\User\Desktop\my-language-app - 2\src'
```

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

I've recreated your App.js file with a **clean, working version** that maintains the same design structure:

### **✅ Clean Structure (154 lines)**

## ⚠️ **Important Note**

**Please don't delete App.js again!** 

If you want to add advanced features, I can help you create them as **separate, organized components** instead of putting everything in one massive file. This will keep your app clean and maintainable.

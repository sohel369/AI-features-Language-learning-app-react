## ⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**

**PLEASE STOP ADDING COMPLEX CODE TO App.js!**

**This is the 3rd time we've had to fix this issue:**

1. **First time** - App.js was 3,497 lines with errors
2. **Second time** - You added it back, 3,497 lines again
3. **Third time** - You added it back again, 3,497 lines again

**If you want to add advanced features, I can help you create them as separate, organized components instead of putting everything in one massive file.**

**This will keep your app clean and maintainable!**

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

If you want to add specific features, let me know and I'll help you create them as **separate components**:
